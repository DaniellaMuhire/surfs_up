The temperature data for the month of December is more spread out compare to the temperature data for the month of June.

- We could also analyze the temperature trends by station to see which station has higher temperatures. 

- We could perform a query to analyze more trends that may affect the Surf business like precipitation, wind conditions, for the month of June and December.
